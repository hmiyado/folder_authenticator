# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code (required after dependency changes or adding new providers/models)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Run the app (starts on connected device/emulator)
flutter run

# Run tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/encryption_service_test.dart

# Analyze code for linting issues
flutter analyze
```

### Code Generation
The project uses build_runner for code generation. Run this whenever you:
- Add new Riverpod providers with `@riverpod` annotation
- Modify existing providers
- Add new model classes with JSON serialization

## Project Architecture

### State Management
- **Riverpod**: Primary state management solution using `flutter_riverpod`
- **Code Generation**: Uses `riverpod_annotation` and `riverpod_generator` for provider generation
- **Pattern**: Repository pattern with providers for dependency injection

### Core Services
- **EncryptionService**: Handles AES-256 CBC encryption of TOTP secrets
- **DatabaseService**: SQLite database operations using `sqflite`
- **ConfigService**: Configuration and encryption key management
- **TotpService**: TOTP code generation using `otp` package

### Data Flow
1. **UI Layer**: Pages and widgets consume Riverpod providers
2. **Provider Layer**: Business logic and state management
3. **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction
4. **Service Layer**: Core functionality (encryption, database, TOTP generation)
5. **Database Layer**: SQLite storage with encrypted TOTP secrets

### Key Directories
- `lib/services/`: Core services (encryption, database, config, TOTP)
- `lib/repositories/`: Data access layer
- `lib/models/`: Data models (Folder, TotpEntry)
- `lib/home/`: Main application screens and folder navigation
- `lib/totp_detail/`: TOTP entry management (view, edit, export)
- `lib/settings/`: Application settings

### Security Architecture
- TOTP secrets are encrypted using AES-256 CBC before database storage
- Encryption key is provided via environment variable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `.env` file
- Key is stored in device secure storage after first use
- See ENCRYPTION.md for detailed security implementation

### Database Schema
- **folders**: Hierarchical folder structure with parent/child relationships
- **totp_entries**: TOTP entries with encrypted secrets, linked to folders
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services and repositories using `mockito`
- Test coverage for encryption/decryption workflows
- Mock database operations for isolated testing

## Code Generation Files
Files ending in `.g.dart` are generated by build_runner and should not be edited manually. If you see import errors for these files, run the code generation command.

## Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root for development:
```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key_here
```
This file is gitignored and required for proper encryption functionality.
